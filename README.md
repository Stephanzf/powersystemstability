# powersystemstability
A power system stability time domain simulation program written in FORTRAN was ported to a Windows GUI interface later on in MATLAB and OCTAVE. The entire package has not been tested on Windows 7 nor Windows 10. There could be compatability issues in FORTRAN versions and/or operating systems.
